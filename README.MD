First week project for Skill Distillery.
Demonstrates: 
* Basic Java skills.
* Using Eclipse for project development.

This project reads the price, the amount tendered and prints the amount in each denomination. 

To run the project, simply run the program in the command line and follow user prompts for any amount below $20. User input for either price paid or cost of the requested item must be below $20 for this simple change machine program to properly function. The program accepts integers or doubles as input values, but no characters or words. For example, you will not get a correct output if you write the words "ten dollars," or enter $10, the program will not recognize the $ symbol and will break. The user must enter 10 or 10.0 for it to give proper output. Thanks for looking!
